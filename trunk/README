THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO INSTALL AND USE THIS SOFTWARE ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, PLEASE
WAIT UNTIL A STABLE VERSION IS RELEASED, IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO CONTRIBUTE CODE AND FEEDBACK TO THE DEVELOPERS, PLEASE FOLLOW
THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW

in order to compile the bluetooth daemon, the following packages
are needed ( package names are referred to those available in
Ubuntu Linux 5.10, names can vary depending on the GNU/Linux
distribution you're using )

libdbus-1-dev
libbluetooth1-dev
libsigc++-2.0-dev
python2.4-dev

in order to use the graphical tools included in the /extras
subdirectory in the source tree, the following python packages
are also needed

python2.4-dbus
python2.4-gtk2
python2.4-gnome2
python2.4-gnome2-extras

once those packages are installed, you can configure the daemon
and the libraries with

./configure

from the root directory.
To compile the source, just do

make

from the same directory

NOTE:	install targets are not in the build scripts yet,here's how
	to run the daemon:

1) copy ./bin/daemon/bluetool.conf into /etc/dbus-1/system.d/
2) restart dbus
3) run ./bin/daemon/bluetool-daemon as root

NOTE:	the daemon does not 'daemonize' actually, this makes debug
	output available on the console
